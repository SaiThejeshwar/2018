# Joint Chapter of IEEE Computational Intelligence, Geoscience and Remote Sensing Societies
## About the Chapter
IEEE CIS/GRSS Chapter Hyderabad is a vibrant group having members from both Industry and academia with sole mission of promoting computational Intelligence technologies that are of societal importance and benefit the Human kind. In the recent years we have seen a phenomenal growth in value driven businesses and mobile platforms that provide valuable user centric services to individuals. On the other hand advances in Geoscience and Remote sensing has transformed our understanding of the earth, oceans, atmosphere, and space systems through improved processing and interpretation. Many of the outcomes are being utilized for societal benefits. The continious collections of data from multiple variety of sensors from multiple satellites is resulting in large volumes of data. The challenges associated with processing and understanding is presently of wide interests to industry, research organizations and academia. The current focus of the Industry is to develop systems that can learn, behave in an intelligent manner to maximize their automation, the growth in utilization of remote sensing data there is huge scope and potential in the growth of CI technologies. The main goal of the chapter is to bring together professionals from academia and Industry to share their research findings on these frontiers. Also, one of our objectives is to harness the skills of young professionals and students through their involvement in the chapter activities. Volunteers are the veins of the chapter, so we are in continuous look out for strong self motivated individuals to volunteer and steer the chapter to realize its vision. We welcome your suggestions and participations in our activities.
## History
The Chapter was founded in 2011 by Dr. Amit Kumar. Dr. Amit Kumar chaired the chapter from 2011-2012. The chapter under his leadership received the outstanding CIS chapter award in 2013. Prof. Atul Negi chaired the chapter from 2013 to 2015. The present chair Dr. Naresh Kumar is steering the chapter from 2016 onwards. Under his leadership a computational intelligence, Geoscience and Remote Sensing societies joint chapter was envisaged and formed in 2017. His outstanding contributions as volunteer has won accolades from CIS resulting in yet another outstanding CIS chapter award for actitivites done in 2016.

## Activities
IEEE CIS chapter Hyderabad Section has organized more than 25 events this year. We have organized hands on sessions, technical talks, workshops with experts from premier academic institutions and Industry such as Indian Statistical Institute kolkota, PES University, Mahindra ecole Centrale, Infosys and Microsoft. Recently, we have organized a flagship event titled “John Mc Carthy Memorial Lectures series” which is widely accepted by the CIS community. The first lecture was delivered by Prof. C.A. Murthy, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and the Second lecture was delivered by Prof. Raghu Krishnapuram, Fellow IEEE. Recently, we have started GRSS flagship event titled "Richard Moore Memorial Lectures". The first lecture was delivered Dr. Paul A. Rosen, JPL, NASA. We propose to take forward our experiential learning to organize innovative programs that provide oppurtunities for all classes our memberships in 2018.

## Opportunities
### Educational Activities 2018 - Graduate Student Research Grants

The IEEE CIS is inviting applications for funding opportunity, for deserving undergraduate, graduate and PhD students who need financial support to carry out their research during an academic break period. Any student with a meritorious project is invited to apply, but scholarships will be granted only to applicants who are student members of the IEEE CIS and students at the time the scholarship is awarded.
The primary intent of these scholarships is to cover the expenses related to a visit to another university, institute or research agency for collaboration with an identified researcher in the field of interest of the applicant. Funds can be used to cover travel expenses as well as certain living expenses (such as housing). The field of interest of applicants is open, but should be connected with identifiable component of the CIS (neural networks, fuzzy systems, or evolutionary computation).
The amount of a CIS scholarship varies from $1,000 to $4,000. We expect to award 3-5 scholarships, but it depends on the budget approved by CIS ADCOM. Deadline for submission of applications is Mar 15, 2018. Please refer to the details or contact Bing.Xue@ecs.vuw.ac.nz.

### Second John McCarthy Memorial Lecture by Prof. Raghu Krishnapuram, Fellow IEEE
#### Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence and Potential Applications
Abstract : In the recent past, many areas of artificial Intelligence (AI) such as machine learning and deep
learning have seen developments at a breakneck speed. Major IT firms are investing heavily in
these areas to gain a strategic advantage. This intense competition has resulted in many novel AI
technologies, which are being incorporated into a plethora of applications in a variety of domains.
This talk will provide an overview of the hype and reality behind the recent claims by the AI
community, and outline its potential use in a variety of domains. Deep learning techniques are
capable of making sense out of large volumes of disparate data, and (deep) reinforcement
learning can deal with complex control and planning scenarios. Therefore, in combination, these
techniques can be used to address many real world challenges.

### First Richard Moore Memorial Lecture by Dr. Paul A. Rosen, JPL, NASA and Fellow IEEE
#### Innovations in synthetic aperture radar: past, present and future
Abstract :  The age ofspaceborne radar remote sensing was born in 1978 with the launch of SEASAT, an experimental satellite carry an array of microwave instruments − a radiometer, an altimeter, and a synthetic aperture radar. SEASAT demonstrated in its short lifespan theuniqueness and utility of radar’s all−weather day/night capabilities and led to a sustained and accelerating international growth in
the number and variety of radar instrumentsthat are orbiting Earth and the planets. Unlike optical sensors, radarsees the electrical
and structural properties of an object and therefore give us a view of worlds that is quite different from our everyday experience.
With wavelengthsthatspan a range from millimetersto kilometers, radars can scatterfrom ice crystals in clouds as well as penetrate
deep into ice crusts of planetary objects. Spacefaring nations consider Earth imaging radar to be critical to theirscientific and oper−
ational needs, and a growing number of systems are being launched around the world. The volume of radar data being acquired of
Earth is growing rapidly as the benefits of continuous time−series around the globe are becoming apparent. Sophisticated
techniques in change detection and quantitative geodesy using interferometric and polarimetric methods are revolutionizing the
fields of solid earth science, glaciology, and ecosystems science, among others. Radar altimeters operationally measure ocean
topography,mm−wavelength radarsounders profile cloud and precipitation, and scatterometers determine oceanwinds. These data
are becoming essential climate records, with a scientific imperative for continuing measurements. With the availability of low−cost
space−qualified digital hardware,radars are becomingmore flexible,more capable, and less expensive per unit area observed. Along
with the standardization of cubesats and smallspacecraG, many companies are now planning dense constellations ofradarsatellites
to feed the growing commercial market for radar imagery. In addition to facility−class missions are becoming more capable and
flexible collecting petabytes of data each year. This will only grow in the future. In this talk, an overview of the major developments
in spaceborne radar systems will be presented, highlighting the intersections of science and innovation in spaceborne radar
developments, including some of the most interesting science and technology achievements obtained over the years, and describe
upcoming initiatives that support future directions in Earth and planetary observations.
