# Joint Chapter of IEEE Computational Intelligence, Geoscience and Remote Sensing Societies
## About the Chapter
IEEE CIS/GRSS Chapter Hyderabad is a vibrant group having members from both Industry and academia with sole mission of promoting computational Intelligence technologies that are of societal importance for the benefit of Human kind. In the recent years we have seen a phenomenal growth in value driven businesses and mobile platforms that provide valuable user centric services to individuals. This resulted in large volumes of data coming from multitude of devices connected to internet. This has resulted in what we call the problem of BigData. The current focus of the Industry is to develop systems that can learn, behave in an intelligent manner to maximize their automation, there is huge scope and potential in the growth of CI technologies. The main goal of CIS chapter is to bring together professionals from academia and Industry to share their research findings on these frontiers. Also, one of our objectives is to harness the skills of young professionals and students through their involvement in the chapter activities. Also, there is a strong need for volunteers to take forward the Chapters’ mission. We welcome your suggestions and participations in our activities.
Activities
IEEE CIS chapter Hyderabad Section has organized more than 25 events this year. We have organized hands on sessions, technical talks, workshops with experts from premier academic institutions and Industry such as ISI, kolkota, PES University, Mahindra ecole Centrale, Infosys and Microsoft. Recently, we have organized a flagship event titled “John Mc Carthy Memorial Lectures series” which is widely accepted by the CIS community. We propose to take forward the existing experiential learning to organize summer internship programs and conferences in coming year 2017.
